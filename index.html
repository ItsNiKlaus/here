                <h2>Introduction To Fatima Al Zahraa</h2>
                <code>Fatima Al Zahra. This name is not just a name to me now because this name has become so much more to me. It is something that makes my heart skip a beat because it is the name of the most prettiest, most cutest and the most kawaii person i have met in my entire life. It is the name of the girl i love and adore the most and that is you. if someone comes up to me and asks me what kind of a person fatima al zahraa is, i would say "she is the ray of hope in this never-ending darkness, she is the warmth to my cold blood, she is the reason of the smile i have and she is the one i go to when i feel like going home". So, Fatima Al Zahraa, in simple words, when i feel like running from everything, you are the one i run towards and that is how safe i feel with you, you are my home and that is how i would describe about you.</code>

                <code>So, Let me tell you a little about the past, let me tell you what i thought and felt when i met you, i still remember the day when i first met you, when i first saw a girl with the name Senorita talking in the chat and ofcourse how can we forget the heart your name had, making it SENORITA❤️. So, when i first saw you, you were so cheery and full of energy and you had pictures on your profile and i sent your profile to tanny asap and told him how pretty you look and as usual, tanny loved how the pictures and your eyes so he texted you and tried to flirt with you but poor tanny got rejected, hehe. So, this is about the moment and the day i met you in 2020. I took a liking to you the moment we met and felt like talking to you.</code>

                <code>As we have read in previous chapter, i took a liking to you and wanted to talk to you. So, as i remember i was trying to find excuses to talk to this lovely girl i met and i found one and texted you, the first impression of yours that i have is that i loved your voice the moment i heard it, i felt interested in you and felt like wanting to talk even more. You were so full of light, so cheery, so pretty, even childish and times but most of all, you were lovely and i never felt bored with you, i just wanted to talk to you more and more and i used to find excuses to talk to you. when we started talkingand i still remember that how time fast time used to pass without me noticing a minute, tho you used to be a bit cold a lot of times and i always used to be the one to make up to you even though i had a shitty personality back then. simply, it was because i always felt attracted to you and no matter how many times we fought, i always used to go back to you, it was like i was connected to you in ways that i myself did not know.

I really loved our time and memories together. you know fatima, i lost someone i love at that time and i also found you at that time, i still remember that you texted me when my dad passed away and it made me feel better because somehow you made me feel safe and to be honest, i kinda had developed feelings for you at that time and i was guilty about em but at the same time it felt amazing.</code>

                <code>The two things that always came in between the confrontation of my feelings were these. First, My Identity. I always felt that even if i confront you about my feelings i would be scamming you by impersonating someone else and i thought that even if you like me in any way, you like the person in pfp and not the actual me so i felt guilty and scared about confronting you. Second, Manu, He came up to me and told me to stop talking to you because you are his gf and i got annoyed by it and felt bad so i went to you and asked you if you were his gf and you completely denied and then i did a baka thing and sent that ss to manu and he told you about it and we fought, he lied to you about some things like he told you that i abused you which was definitely not true. anyways, moving forward, then we fought and stopped talking.</code>

                    Suddenly, It felt like this to me, have you ever felt like this? Like one day you wake up and you're in this place. You're in this place where everything feels right. Your heart is calm. Your soul is pure. Your thoughts are clear. Your faith in allah is stronger and positive. Your point of view is stronger than ever and you're at peace. That is how i felt and for that i am grateful to you. I am grateful that I met you, thank you for being there for me especially when I needed you the most. You also helped me become a better person in ways I can't explain. I want you to remember that no matter what happen between us, i will always be your biggest supporter. Always. All ways. <br> <br>
